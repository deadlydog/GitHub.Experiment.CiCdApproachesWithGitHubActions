# GitHub Experiment - CI/CD Approaches with GitHub Actions

## üí¨ Description

This repo is used to experiment and explore CI/CD approaches with GitHub Actions.

## ‚ùì Why this exists

GitHub Actions is very flexible and configurable, so there are multiple ways we can setup CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment) pipelines.
This repo is used to experiment and explore different approaches, so we can compare and contrast them to see which approach is best for a given scenario.
